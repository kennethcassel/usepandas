Kurtosis! It's a neat statistical measure that tells you how different from a normal distribution
a given set of data is. In particular it measures if data are heavy-tailed or light tailed when
compared to a normal distribution.

The lower the number is, the less outliers exist in the data. The higher it is, the more outliers exist.

Let's take a look at the kurtosis for the `price` column in the following .csv of housing data.

## homes_sorted.csv

| Address         | Price   | Bedrooms |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| 992 Settled St  | 823,049 | 4        |
| 1506 Guido St   | 784,049 | 3        |
| 247 Fort St     | 299,238 | 3        |
| 132 Walrus Ave  | 299,001 | 2        |
| 491 Python St   | 293,923 | 4        |
| 4981 Anytown Rd | 199,000 | 4        |
| 938 Zeal Rd     | 148,398 | 2        |
| 123 Main St     | 99,000  | 1        |

## How to measure kurtosis with Python pandas

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('/Users/kennethcassel/homes_sorted.csv')

df['price'].kurtosis()
```

## Output: `-0.29610470855022797`

## Conclusion:

It's super easy to analyze data to find kurtosis using python pandas.

Our dataset had a low kurtosis measurement. A normal distribution is 3. Anything below 1 is
considered a light-tailed set of data. Anything higher than 1 is heavy tailed.
