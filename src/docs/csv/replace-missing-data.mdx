When working with real-world data sometimes you'll find that the data have missing values.
This can happen for a lot of reasons: Errors in the ETL, the user did not provide that information,
a new field was introduce to the database and old rows have no values, etc.

Suppose you have this dataset and you want to replace all the NaN values in the Bedrooms column with non-NaN values.

## homes_sorted.csv

| Address         | Price   | Bedrooms |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| 992 Settled St  | 823,049 | 4.0      |
| 1506 Guido St   | 784,049 | 3.0      |
| 247 Fort St     | 299,238 | NaN      |
| 132 Walrus Ave  | 299,001 | 2.0      |
| 491 Python St   | 293,923 | NaN      |
| 4981 Anytown Rd | 199,000 | 4.0      |
| 938 Zeal Rd     | 148,398 | NaN      |
| 123 Main St     | 99,000  | 1.0      |

Let's try the simplest method first.

## Method 1: Replace NaN with constant value

```python
import pandas as pd

df_homes = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/kennethcassel/homes_sorted.csv")

# To fill NaN values from a column use pandas fillna() function
# and pass it the value with which you want to replace the missing values
df_homes['Bedrooms'] = df_homes['Bedrooms'].fillna(1)

df_homes.to_csv('homes_imputed.csv', index=False)

```

After that, your dataset should look like this:

## homes_imputed.csv

| Address         | Price   | Bedrooms |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| 992 Settled St  | 823,049 | 4.0      |
| 1506 Guido St   | 784,049 | 3.0      |
| 247 Fort St     | 299,238 | 1.0      |
| 132 Walrus Ave  | 299,001 | 2.0      |
| 491 Python St   | 293,923 | 1.0      |
| 4981 Anytown Rd | 199,000 | 4.0      |
| 938 Zeal Rd     | 148,398 | 1.0      |
| 123 Main St     | 99,000  | 1.0      |

## Method 2: Replace NaN with most common value

```python
import pandas as pd

df_homes = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/kennethcassel/homes_sorted.csv")

# Instead of filling missing values with a random number
# we fill them with the most common value.
# The [0] after function mode() is necessary because mode()
# returns a dataset insted of an int/float
df_homes['Bedrooms'] = df_homes['Bedrooms'].fillna(
                                                df_home['Bedrooms'].mode()[0]
                                            )

df_homes.to_csv('homes_imputed.csv', index=False)

df = pd.DataFrame()

```

After that, all NaN values should be replaced with 4.0

| Address         | Price   | Bedrooms |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| 992 Settled St  | 823,049 | 4.0      |
| 1506 Guido St   | 784,049 | 3.0      |
| 247 Fort St     | 299,238 | 4.0      |
| 132 Walrus Ave  | 299,001 | 2.0      |
| 491 Python St   | 293,923 | 4.0      |
| 4981 Anytown Rd | 199,000 | 4.0      |
| 938 Zeal Rd     | 148,398 | 4.0      |
| 123 Main St     | 99,000  | 1.0      |
